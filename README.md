# Navigator-II
C++ Code to run on arduino to drive all in one harmonic drive equatorial mount; Included are functions to zero, jog, track stars, shoot light and dark frames from camera while tracking
# Navigator II â€” Dual-Axis Equatorial Mount Controller

An Arduino-based precision controller for an astrophotography equatorial mount, designed to automate sidereal tracking and camera exposure sequences with dual stepper motors.

## ðŸ”­ Project Overview
Navigator II is a fully self-contained mount controller that integrates mechanical control, coordinate computation, and camera triggering. 
It allows users to home the telescope, jog in Right Ascension and Declination, automate exposure sequences, and maintain tracking â€” all through a simple LCD interface and analog joystick-style menu.

This system replaces the need for commercial GoTo mounts by implementing its own coordinate transformation and limit switch calibration logic.
